# Oh, *my* zsh

I got awfully tired of oh-my-zsh (slow, confused, overwhelming, it assumed I
wanted a lot more than I actually did).

This is a zsh configuration which perfectly suits my needs.

### Installation

    git clone git@github.com:whatyouhide/zsh-config.git --recursive
    cd zsh-config
    rake install
